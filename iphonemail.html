<p>The District Magistrate Nainital, Uttarakhand</p>
<p><strong>Subject:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Appeal for taking immediate action against the installation of an illegal bore well in Village Satoli, Patti Malli Kutoli, District Nainital located at Khet No. 1300 Khata No. 108 being used for commercial purposes in complete defiance of the law</strong></p>
<p>This petition is with reference to the above-mentioned subject matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aforementioned illegal bore well is in the name of one Vipin Chand Pant, a resident of Bhowali Village who was granted permission for the borewell in the Satoli area 10 years back, even when he was not a resident of Satoli and had no property in the location in question. Moreover, he still does not own any residential property in the site location. It is important to mention here that even after getting the permission, he did not do anything in order to use the permission. Now, after the lapse of the permission, he again applied for fresh permission and he was permitted within 24 hours by the Sub-divisional officer, Pragana Magistrate, without looking into the ground realities and the change in circumstances in these 10 years. The permission was given on 09.02.2021 without following the procedure of consulting the villagers, inspection, and verification from a special hydrologist, which are important to ascertain the impact of the permission on the Ecology. The borewell is now operational and it is pertinent to mention here that its water is being diverted by the builders for commercial use (construction of high-end villas) via an illegal water line, connecting the borewell with the construction site, hundreds of meters away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This mail is being sent to express my deep shock, anguish, and frustration at the recent turn of events in Village Satoli, Patti Mulli Katoli, District Nainital, where the said bore well has been dug for commercial misuse under the garb of residential use. All established laws, norms, and guidelines have been flouted, unleashing a trail of destruction with regards to our water resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is reiterated here that the fresh permission given to Vipin Chand Pant on 09.02.2021 was not proper and was illegal as it did not follow the procedure laid down in law and did not take into consideration the requirements as per the law and hence, liable to be canceled. Moreover, the said permission was given for residential purposes but the same is being misused for commercial purposes. It is not even possible to measure how much water is being abstracted daily by the builder who is diverting the water for the construction of high-end Villas in Satoli village.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The concern of the villagers is that there are several households that will be badly impacted by this illegal act. Villages of Satoli, Diyari, Peora, and others will face acute water shortages if this rampant misuse is not stopped, also resulting in long-term water scarcity and ecological imbalance.</p>

<p>Further, there are various important programmes, in the area of health, education, livelihood, and women empowerment are being run by AAROHI, a prominent and reputed NGO in Satoli which will be negatively impacted.</p>

<p>Needless to say, groundwater abstraction is highly regulated by law, given the devastating impact, it has on the environment. Misuse of groundwater is a punishable offense.</p>
<p><a href="https://hilansh.com/news/villagers-of-satoli-gathered-against-the-loot-of-water-in-uttarakhands-nainital-district">https://hilansh.com/news/villagers-of-satoli-gathered-against-the-loot-of-water-in-uttarakhands-nainital-district</a></p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that digging borewells in ecologically sensitive hill areas is a recipe for disaster. Since hilly areas do not have a water table under the surface, bore wells draw on all available water channels. The most disturbing aspect of a boring activity in the hills is that it taps into or cuts through any of the water channels and sucks out the water from the capillaries, ultimately leading to drying up of the water source of villages at lower altitudes.</p>
<p><a href="https://devbhoomisamachaar.com/index.php/2021/09/20/a-civil-movement-against-environmental-destruction/">https://devbhoomisamachaar.com/index.php/2021/09/20/a-civil-movement-against-environmental-destruction/</a></p>
<p>A plethora of judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, National Green Tribunal, and High</p>
<p>Courts have held that it is the legal obligation of the state to act against those who violate the law and misuse the natural resources of the country.</p>
<p>It is requested that strict and immediate action be taken against those responsible for this flagrant violation of the law, taking into consideration the above-mentioned issues and impact of the misuse of the water on the Ecology and the lives of villagers. Unchecked abstraction of groundwater will have a devastating impact and set a dangerous precedent.</p>

<p>As a citizen of India and someone who is deeply concerned with the environmental degradation of the Kumaon region, I do hope that due action will be taken against the violators.</p>
<p>Please help us Save Kumaon!</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
