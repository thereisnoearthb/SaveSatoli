<p>The District Magistrate Nainital, Uttarakhand</p>
<p><strong>Subject:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Appeal for taking immediate action against the installation of an illegal bore well in Village Satoli, Patti Malli Kutoli, District Nainital located at Khet No. 1300 Khata No. 108 being used for commercial purposes in complete defiance of the law</strong></p>
<p>This mail is being sent to express my deep shock, anguish and frustration at the recent turn of events in Village Satoli, Patti Mulli Katoli, District Nainital, where the said bore well has been dug for commercial misuse under the garb of residential use. All established laws, norms and guidelines have been flouted, unleashing a trail of destruction with regards to our water resources. Moreover, it is not even possible to measure how much water is being abstracted daily by the builder who is diverting the water for the construction of high-end Villas in Satoli village though the permission was for residential purposes. The concern of the villagers is that there are several households which will be badly impacted by this illegal act. Villages of Satoli, Diyari, Peora and others will face acute water shortage if this rampant misuse is not stopped, also resulting in long term water scarcity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, there are various important programmes, in the area of health, education, livelihood and women empowerment are being run by AAROHI, a prominent and reputed NGO in Satoli which will be negatively impacted.</p>

<p>Needless to say, groundwater abstraction is highly regulated by law, given the devastating impact it has on the environment. Misuse of groundwater is a punishable offence.</p>

<p>Digging bore wells in the ecologically sensitive hill areas is a recipe for disaster. Since hilly areas do not have a water-table under the surface, bore wells draw on all available water channels. The mostdisturbing aspect of a boring activity in the hills is that it taps into or cuts through any of the water channels and sucks out the water from the capillaries, ultimately leading todrying up of the water source of villages at lower altitude.</p>

<p>A plethora of judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, National Green Tribunal and High</p>
<p>Courts have held that it is the legal obligation of the state to act against those who violate the law and misuse natural resources of the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://devbhoomisamachaar.com/index.php/2021/09/20/a-civil-movement-against-environmental-destruction/">https://devbhoomisamachaar.com/index.php/2021/09/20/a-civil-movement-against-environmental-destruction/</a></p>
<p>It is requested that strict and immediate action be taken against those responsible for this flagrant violation of the law. Unchecked abstraction of ground water will have a devastating impact and set a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>As a citizen of India and someone who is deeply concerned with the environmental degradation of the Kumaon region, I do hope that due action will be taken against the violators.</p>

<p>Sincerely</p>
